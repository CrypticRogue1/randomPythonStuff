# I did this in class last time with c++ but it's been a while
# So I'm probably not completely sure how to do this then

# 3.0/4.0 <-- Scale (5.0 scale?)
# A/B/C/D & A+/A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/C-/D+/D/D-/F+/F/F- <-- Scale
#
# How about I just do 4.0 with the pluses and minueses...

#---------
# Let's start with the one I know. 4.0_with_A/B/C/D
