# This only makes sense...
    Since I already have a folder that is basically dedicated to cpp stuff. I'll just
    have this one for python stuff.
# This is the new plan:
    I will be making this a place- for now, a place where I put into work what I have learned. 
    I'll try writing some notes on an app that is a note taking app and then execute things here.
        # Good Plan man
