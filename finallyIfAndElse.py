# Example in book

name = "Mary"
password = "swordfish"

if name == "Mary":
    print("Hello, Mary.")
    if password == "swordfish":
        print("Access Granted.")
    else:
        print("Wrong Password.")

# I want to automate this so that later it can literally be like, you enter your password
# and then it checks if it's correct and does the stuff in this program.

# This is really weird
